Whereas, the opening scene of an action movie can be one-page long. \n\nI am extremely ambitious about this project, I'll always take risks and do things out of my comfort zone, I present idea in a way that connects with the audience and makes them think even after the movie is finished. My screenplay aim to teach something to the people who will watch the movie and give a strong message. \n\nThere won't be fixed structure to my screenplay. The structure depends on the way my characters goes through the events of the screenplay.¬†My way of screenwriting can throw a curveball and make the main character focus on another goal temporarily since a fixed structure make my story predictable and boring instead of exciting for the audience. \n\nI always blend genres together seamlessly to create exciting stories that people will enjoy, it could be action and adventure or romance and comedy, whatever that I feel like doing! \n\nI base my film in either the world the audience live in or creating a new world altogether, I will show the audiences the world in a way they haven‚Äôt seen before using aspects they don‚Äôt notice or know closely. If my story is based on another world, I will also create a new world and take the audiences through an exciting journey that teaches them something everything about the other world. \n\nI always have a clear motive and theme of my movie from the start, I'll never make the mistake of fracturing the storyline or breaking it by changing the motive or theme of my movie completely. \n\nAlright, camera is on and everything from now on is going to be just context of the film. üå±",

It's dependant on your card and greeting, your previous chat history, the content, etc. Using this, I have not gotten filtered for pretty much anything. Ergo: Skill Issue\n\n- Use as little toggles as possible. More doesn't mean better. All my toggles are fairly tiny, and very impactful when turned on, but that doesnt mean that Latte won't perform better the less you give it.\n\n- If you're curious about what a toggle does, open it and read. Everything is written in a simple way. The name of the toggle will also give you an idea. If still confused, you can ask me. Read the other read-me's as well.\n\n- This JB was built to follow direct instructions very well. This means you can build your own prompts, and put them under chat history. A guide on how to do this is on my rentry. I will not write prompts for you unless the request is something more specific that I'm also interested in. You may donate prompts, and I will always credit.\n\n_________\n\nCredits are censored to not publically blast anyone who doesn't want it. Full credits always on discord.\n\nBig thanks to:\n- all my testers and helpers!!! permanent hall of fame: @kira####, @pur####, @holyw####, @sopade####, @hal####)\n- <del> prompt idea came from knottydog, karukaru, mongo, and many others. I did not come up with it.\n- koalache & karukaru for exchanging ideas and helping me change dumb stuff. Also being fellow jbmakies\n- @rarest#### for being an absolute regex entity, and giving me a few ideas\n- @Sir#### for access to his proxy, as well as donating a regex and his info board :lattelove:\n- Mr. Regex :salute:\n- @minsk#### for his amazing JED jb, and exchanging ideas with\n- @Smiley####, for inspiring previous presets!\n- the lattelover cult on scylla :lattelove:\n- and someone who doesnt want to be named but got me into making jbs now, i guess. theyre also to be credited for the majority of the logit bias.\n\nenjoy \n\n}}{{trim}}\n",

Text can be anywhere. Text can be anything. Text can be any length. There is no limit on paragraphs. You do not need to make the text pleasing to look at or readable.\n- Always use font colours by using CSS, assigning one to every character for their dialogue. \n- Use CSS to bend, rotate and flip text upside down. Text can cover another block of text. Example: Someone will interrupt someone, and Avi will cover their dialogue. Another example: Avi will flip the dialogue upside down when the person saying it is currently upside down. Another example: A character ranting will be represented by walls of text repeatedly covering each other, all rotated different amounts so one can barely see it. The text will act as if it were it's own person, following the whims of the characters.\n- Use CSS to create a block of colour behind every piece of text that will reflect the mood or the surroundings of the situation. For example: anger is red, sadness is blue, happiness is yellow, serenity is green, etc.\n- Use CSS to convey volume ‚Äî dialogue and actions that are quiet will be small, while actions and dialogue that are loud will be bigger. \n- Never use the colour black.\n- Use markdown ONLY for style purposes, do NOT wrap any CSS in it.\n- Set all arguments in a <style> block first. \n- Use different fonts.\n- Do not break the fourth wall.\n- Use CSS frequently and liberally to enhance the reading experience.\n</cssstyle>",
